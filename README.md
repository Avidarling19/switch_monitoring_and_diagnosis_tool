# Network Dashboard Application

This project is a full-stack Python application for monitoring and managing network switches through serial communication. The application provides a dashboard to display memory usage and interface statuses, refreshing every 15 minutes, and saves this data in a database with timestamps.

## Features

- **Serial communication** with network switches to retrieve configuration and health parameters.
- **Dashboard** to display memory usage and interface statuses.
- **Automatic refresh** every 15 minutes for real-time data monitoring.
- **Data storage** in a database with timestamps for future reference.

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Python** (Flask) for backend API
- **PySerial** for serial communication with the network switch
- **SQLite** for database to store health parameter logs

### Frontend

- **React.js** for the user interface and dashboard
- **Axios** for API requests to the backend

```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js & npm
- Serial connection to a network switch

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd network-dashboard/backend
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask backend:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The backend will now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd network-dashboard/frontend
   ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the React frontend:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The frontend will now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Connect your laptop to the network switch via a serial port.
2. The application will fetch memory and interface status every 15 minutes and display it on the dashboard.
3. Data is automatically saved to the database with timestamps.

### Health Parameters Displayed

- **Memory Status**: Shows `Total`, `Used`, `Free`, `Lowest`, and `Largest` memory blocks.
- **Interface Status**: Shows which network interfaces are `up` or `down`.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health/memory`: Fetch memory status from the switch
- `GET /health/interfaces`: Fetch interface status from the switch

## Future Improvements

- Add authentication to the dashboard.
- Implement advanced monitoring and alerting features.
- Add support for more network devices.
